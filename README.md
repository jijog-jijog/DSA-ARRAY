# ðŸ”‘ How to Use This Roadmap

- Start from the easy section and move sequentially.
- Early problems focus on array manipulation and matrix basics.
- Medium problems build on traversals, sorting, searching, and dynamic programming.
- Hard problems introduce advanced concepts like sliding windows and number theory.
- This order is designed so each problem introduces or reinforces concepts used in the next.
